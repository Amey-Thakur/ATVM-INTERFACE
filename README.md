<!-- OVERVIEW -->
<a name="overview"></a>
## Overview

The **ATVM (Automatic Ticket Vending Machine) Interface** is a user-centric digital simulation designed to optimize the commuter ticketing experience. The system streamlines the workflow for public transport access, reducing transaction time and cognitive friction through a clean, linear interface design.

### HMI Principles
The development of this interface was guided by core **Human-Machine Interaction** paradigms:
*   **Direct Manipulation**: Users interact directly with visual representations of travel zones and ticket types, reducing the abstraction gap between intent and action.
*   **Feedback**: The system provides immediate visual responsiveness (color changes, summary updates) to every user input, ensuring the user is always aware of the system state.

> [!TIP]
> **Fitts's Law in Action**
>
> The interface layout strategically sizes and places interactive buttons (like 'Book Ticket' and Map Zones) to minimize cursor travel time and maximize target acquisition accuracy. This adherence to **Fitts's Law** ensures that high-frequency actions become motor reflexes for the user, significantly speeding up the transaction process in high-volume public transport scenarios.
